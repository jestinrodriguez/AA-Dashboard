## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

## üí° Notes on Auth Implementation

Consider separating Google login behavior in the following cases:

- **Custom User Flows:** For handling new users uniquely (e.g., onboarding, collecting extra profile data, tracking, etc.).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

- **ShadCN UI:** Chose this component library for its pre-built components and fast development. However, some components were hard to fully customize, requiring more effort to adjust them.
- **Firebase Authentication:** Used Firebase for easy and secure user authentication. The trade-off was the need for extra work on error handling and validation, which I handled with **Zod**.
- **Zod for Form Validation:** Opted for Zod due to its simplicity and compatibility with TypeScript. It gave better control and type safety.
- **TailwindCSS:** Used TailwindCSS for quick styling and flexibility. It helped keep the styling consistent and easy to manage.
- **React Router:** Chose React Router for navigation due to its simplicity.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Spent

- 1‚Äì2 hours: Design ideation
- 2‚Äì4 hours: UI implementation
- 1‚Äì2 hours: Firebase Auth error handling & Zod validation
- 30 mins: Router navigation setup
- 2‚Äì4 hours: Debugging, additional testing, and UI polishing

> ‚è≥ **Note:** While the original estimate was approximately 5 hours, I took extra time to ensure high quality and functionality. I focused on polishing the UI, fixing bugs, and validating the experience to make sure it worked smoothly. I believe this extra effort was valuable in delivering a complete and reliable result.
